# This programme Open a file and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of 
# words using the split() method. The program should build a list of words. For each word on each 
# line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list. When the program completes, 
# sort and print the resulting words in python sort() order as shown in the desired output.

# This programme also shows how to use "**if** x **in** y" logical expression.
